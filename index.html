        <p> I'm khaled , I'm in my second year of studying computer science at Birzeit University, and I'm really excited about the journey ahead. Coding has always fascinated me, and I’m especially looking forward to diving deeper into full-stack development. I know there's a lot to learn, but I'm committed to improving my skills and tackling new challenges. I can’t wait to see how I can apply what I learn to create innovative solutions and projects in the tech world! </p>

        <p> Ramallah is my city, nestled in the heart of Palestine's West Bank. It's a place where modernity meets tradition, bustling with life and cultural richness. As the administrative capital of the Palestinian National Authority, it's a hub for political and social activities, drawing a diverse crowd of locals and visitors alike. The city thrives with a vibrant arts scene, featuring cafes, theaters, and galleries that are a testament to our resilient spirit and creativity. Despite the ongoing political challenges, Ramallah stands as a beacon of Palestinian culture and heritage, always reminding me of the strength and unity of our community.</p>
